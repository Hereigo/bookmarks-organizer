[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/cadeyrn/bookmarks-organizer.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

## Description

With the Bookmarks Organizer, it's easy to put order in your bookmarks. The Bookmarks Organizer finds no longer working
bookmarks, redirects, duplicates and more!

**The Bookmarks Organizer is a WebExtension and also compatible with Firefox 57 and later.**

### Features

- Finds no longer working bookmarks
- Finds duplicate bookmarks
- Finds bookmarks without name
- Broken bookmarks can be edited or deleted
- Detects redirects and offers the automatic correction of individual or all redirects

### Shortcuts

The interface can also be accessed via the keyboard. For this purpose the combination **Ctrl + Shift + L
(macOS: Cmd + Shift + L)** is reserved.

It is also possible to start individual tests directly via the address bar:

- **bookmarks organizer**: opens the interface
- **bookmarks duplicates**: search for duplicates
- **bookmarks empty-names**: search for bookmarks without name
- **bookmarks errors**: search for broken bookmarks
- **bookmarks redirects**: search for redirects

### Planned features

There are already some features planned for the future.

- Whitelist: create exceptions for bookmarks, which will no longer be objected to during further checks
- Features for bookmark folders, including empty folders
- & moreâ€¦

### Languages

The extension is currently available in the following languages:

- English
- German
- Dutch (Thanks, Tonnes!)
- Czech (Thanks, MekliCZ!)
- Polish (Thanks, WaldiPL!)
- Upper Sorbian (Thanks, milupo!)
- Lower Sorbian (Thanks, milupo!)

## Compatibility

The extension requires at least Firefox 52. Because the extension makes use of modern web technologies and the latest
WebExtension APIs, support for older versions of Firefox is not possible for technical reasons.
